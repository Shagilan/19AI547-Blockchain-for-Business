# Experiment 8: Post-Quantum Blockchain Wallet with Lattice-Based Cryptography
# Aim:
To create a quantum-resistant wallet using lattice-based cryptography instead of traditional ECDSA, ensuring that future quantum computers cannot break private keys.

# Algorithm:
## Step 1: Understanding Quantum Threat to Blockchain
ECDSA-based wallets are vulnerable to quantum computers.


Lattice-based cryptography (e.g., NTRU, CRYSTALS-Kyber) provides quantum resistance.


## Step 2: Implement Lattice-Based Signature Scheme
Use precomputed NTRU-based public-private keys for authentication.


Store hashed lattice-based signatures instead of traditional Ethereum signatures.


## Step 3: Secure Transactions
Users sign transactions using lattice cryptographic proofs.

 Step 4: Hybrid Cryptographic Transition
Support a dual-signature system (ECDSA + lattice-based) during migration, ensuring backward compatibility while introducing quantum resistance.

 Step 5: Test Post-Quantum Schemes on Testnets
Deploy and test lattice-based cryptography on Ethereum testnets or sidechains to evaluate performance, gas costs, and compatibility.

 Step 6: Educate Users on Key Management
Provide tools and documentation to help users safely generate, store, and use their post-quantum keys without compromising security.




The smart contract verifies the proof before allowing transactions.

}
```

# Expected Output:
Users register using a post-quantum secure public key.


Transactions require a quantum-resistant signature for authentication.


If a traditional quantum-vulnerable hash is used, the transaction fails.
