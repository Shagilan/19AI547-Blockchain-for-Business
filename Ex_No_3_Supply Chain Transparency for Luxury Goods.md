# Aim:
To develop a smart contract that tracks the supply chain of luxury goods, ensuring authenticity.
# Algorithm:
The manufacturer records product creation details on-chain.


The product moves through different supply chain checkpoints.


The ownership of the product can be transferred securely.


Buyers can verify the product’s authenticity.

Tamper-Proof Timestamping
Each transaction or checkpoint update is recorded with a blockchain timestamp, ensuring that no historical data can be altered and the timeline of the product’s journey is verifiable.

 Role-Based Access Control
Implement smart contract permissions so only authorized entities (e.g., manufacturer, distributor, retailer) can update specific fields, preserving data integrity across the supply chain.

 QR Code or NFC Integration
Attach a QR code or NFC tag to each product that links to its blockchain record, allowing real-time authentication by scanning through a mobile app or web portal.

Dispute Resolution Mechanism
Include a smart contract-based system for raising and resolving disputes, such as ownership challenges or counterfeit claims, through multi-signature approvals or arbitration protocols.

# Expected Output:
A luxury good (e.g., a Rolex watch) is registered on-chain.


Ownership is transferred at every checkpoint.


Buyers can check the authenticity before purchasing.


# High-Level Overview:
Helps prevent counterfeit luxury goods.


Teaches real-world supply chain use cases.

# RESULT : 
Thus, a smart contract that tracks the supply chain of luxury goods and ensuring authenticity is successfully executed.
